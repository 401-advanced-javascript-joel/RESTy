# Resty

Lab 23

In this lab, you will be creating an application similar to Postman, called “RESTy”.

Users should have the following interactable components:

- A text input field to enter an API URL
- A collection of buttons / A select dropdown to choose which REST method to use (GET, POST, PUT or DELETE)
- A submit button that sends the request via HTTP

In this lab, you do not need to provide input fields for users to set their request
headers or request body. We will be building upon this application in later labs.

Lab 24

In this final phase of the RESTy build, we will be adding some more fidelity to the application, including a menu, history, and an “in-progress” spinner.

The following user stories detail the major functionality for this phase of the project.

- As a user, I want to be able to use all REST methods so that I can do more than just get data
- As a user, I want a simple list of all previous queries I’ve run so that I can easily see which queries I’ve run before
- As a user, I want to click on an old query and have my selections appear in the form for me, so I don’t have to re-type them
- As a user, I want to see all of my previous queries as a separate page so that I can browse them in greater detail
- As a user, I want to see a “loading” indicator while RESTy is fetching data so that I know it’s working on my request
