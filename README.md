# Lab 23 - Resty

In this lab, you will be creating an application similar to Postman, called “RESTy”.

Users should have the following interactable components:

- A text input field to enter an API URL
- A collection of buttons / A select dropdown to choose which REST method to use (GET, POST, PUT or DELETE)
- A submit button that sends the request via HTTP

In this lab, you do not need to provide input fields for users to set their request
headers or request body. We will be building upon this application in later labs.
